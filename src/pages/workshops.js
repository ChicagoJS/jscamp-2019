        <h2>GraphQL Workshop with Eve Porcello</h2>

        <h3>Friday, September 13, 2019</h3>
        <h5>9am to 5pm</h5>

        <p>
          Want to learn GraphQL but you’re not sure where to get started? Get a
          solid foundation in this hands-on, one-day workshop.
        </p>

        <p>
          In GraphQL, the "Q" stands for Query, which means to question. In this
          course, we're going to learn GraphQL, a special way to ask internet
          servers questions. We are going to learn how to ask these servers all
          sorts of questions at once and allow them to provide all of the
          answers in a single response. Then we'll build our own GraphQL servers
          with Node.js that can answer questions that originate with any client.
        </p>
